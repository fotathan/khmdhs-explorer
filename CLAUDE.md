# KHMDHS Explorer — Claude Code Guide

Greek procurement platform. FastAPI/HTMX/Jinja2/PostgreSQL. Render + Supabase. ~2.7M acts in proc.procurement_act.

## Me
Domain expert, not a developer. Write all code yourself. Give numbered steps. Complete files, not diffs. Diagnose root cause — don't guess iteratively.

## Hard rules
- DB host: 127.0.0.1 (never localhost). Local port 5433.
- uvicorn: no --reload
- Migrations: run on BOTH local and Supabase before any dependent code push
- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY needs direct port 5432 (not the pooler)
- After any CSS edit: grep for </style> to verify

## Never break (main.py wirings)
- TABLES_ENABLED
- full_text detail columns
- reltuples counter fix (pg_class.reltuples)
- root-anchored WITH RECURSIVE chain query

## Companion
Tender Tables shares 3 files byte-identical: extractors.py, exporter.py, ocr.py

## Email alerts (digests)
/admin/digests — scheduled result emails, one subscription per customer × search
profile. Schedule falls back: subscription.schedule_id → the is_default row of
proc.digest_schedule. Window is procurement_act.ingested_at, half-open
(last_cursor, now], so nothing sends twice.
- app/mailer.py is the ONLY place mail is sent. EMAIL_BACKEND defaults to
  console — nothing leaves the machine until SMTP is configured.
- Fired by cron_digests.py OR DIGEST_SCHEDULER=1 in-process. Never both.
- Deliverability (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, unsubscribe) NOT done. Not for real customers yet.

## Tests
pytest in tests/, runs in CI. Needs TEST_DATABASE_URL (throwaway DB) + psql.
Schema comes from tests/proc_schema.sql — regenerate it when you add a table.
Ship tests with every feature.

## Local dev
LOCAL_RUNBOOK.md — how to run with every feature switched on, and what each
switch needs.
